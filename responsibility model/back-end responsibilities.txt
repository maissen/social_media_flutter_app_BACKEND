⚙️ Backend (FastAPI)
🧠 Overview

The backend replaces Firebase and becomes your API + business logic + database layer.
It exposes REST (and optionally WebSocket) endpoints consumed by the Flutter app.

🗄️ Main Components
1. Authentication & Authorization

JWT-based authentication (python-jose, fastapi-users, or custom logic).

Routes for:

/auth/register

/auth/login

/auth/logout

/auth/refresh

Password hashing using bcrypt.

Role-based access (normal user / admin).

Token validation middleware.

2. Database

Use PostgreSQL (or MySQL/MongoDB, depending on your comfort).
ORM: SQLAlchemy + Alembic for migrations.

Example tables:

users

posts

comments

likes

follows

groups

quizzes

notifications

3. Posts & Media

API routes for CRUD:

/posts/ → Create/read/update/delete posts

/posts/{id}/like → Like/unlike

/posts/{id}/comments → Comment

Media uploads handled via:

/upload/image

/upload/video

Media stored in:

Local folder (/media/) during development.

Or cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, MinIO) in production.

4. Social Features

/users/{id}/follow → Follow/unfollow users.

/feed/ → Fetch posts from followed users.

/users/search?query=... → Search by username.

5. Notifications

Real-time updates using:

WebSocket (FastAPI supports it natively), or

Background tasks + push notifications via FCM.

Example event triggers:

When someone likes/comments your post.

When a new friend joins.

6. Educational Features

/quizzes/ → Create, join, or fetch quizzes.

/groups/ → Thematic groups (science, sports, art).

/resources/ → Educational content API.
